Threw me in the lights where I can't run
Shook a hundred hands but don't know one
I seen angels turn to demons
I seen stars fall out the sky
Paranoid and don't know who to trust

Come on now, give it more passion
Come on now, give a little love
Come on now, get a little louder
Now I gotta deal with the devil

I'm burnin', burnin'
Back of my eyes, the fire inside
But I can't go back

It's comin', for me
Trapped in my mind, nowhere to hide
Cause it's on my path

Dependin' on the liquor, pretendin' like ion feel it
But what happens when it all runs out

To get through hell, ya gotta go through a little
To get on that road, you gotta deal with the devil

Double check my doors when I walk in
Cause ain't no tellin who might come through them
My mind, my heart are always racing
I'm almost past the point of breaking
Constant prayin', that I make it

Come on now, give it more passion
Come on now, give a little love
Come on now, get a little louder
Now I gotta deal with the devil

I'm burnin', burnin'
Back of my eyes, the fire inside
But I can't go back

It's comin', for me
Trapped in my mind, nowhere to hide
Cause it's on my path

Dependin' on the liquor, pretendin' like ion feel it
But what happens when it all runs out

To get through hell, ya gotta go through a little
To get on that road, you gotta deal with the devil

Double check my doors when I walk in
Cause ain't no tellin who might come through them
My mind, my heart are always racing

I'm almost passed the point of breaking
I always pray that, I always make the
Right choice but all I hear is voices sayin'
But all I hear is voices sayin'

Come on now, give it more passion
Come on now, give a little love
Come on now, get a little louder
Now I gotta deal with the devil

I'm burnin', burnin'
Back of my eyes, the fire inside
But I can't go back

It's comin', for me
Trapped in my mind, nowhere to hide
Cause it's on my path

Dependin' on the liquor, pretendin' like ion feel it
But what happens when it all runs out

To get through hell, ya gotta go through a little
To get on that road, you gotta deal with the devil
