[00:00.28] Well, Cuphead and his pal Mugman
[00:04.02] They like to roll the dice
[00:07.35] By chance, they came 'pon (the) Devil's Game
[00:11.06] And gosh, they paid the price
[00:15.11] Paid the price
[00:20.05] And now they're fighting for their lives
[00:24.05] On a mission fraught with dread
[00:28.03] And if they proceed but don't succeed
[00:34.09] Well
[00:36.34] The Devil will take their heads
